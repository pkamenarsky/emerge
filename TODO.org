* TODO write `Monoid Out` instance (additive blend)
* TODO wirte `apView :: Syn (u -> v) m a -> Syn u m a -> Syn v m a`
* TODO come up with a way to mark "missing" signals (e.g. ccs)
** is this not just Signal (Maybe v)?
* IDEA livecoding esolang
blend (circle 14 15) *
      sdf * d * e * f * g

star is onClick
etc

* DONE convert between `Syn v ()` and `Mealy () v`
* DONE lift simple op `Op a` into both `Signal a -> Syn Out ()`  and `Mealy a Out`

* PROJECT IDEAS
** explore visual polyrithms; e.g. e.g. union betwen subfigures shapeshifting in polyrithms to each other; be it 2 or more shapes, sdfs, or even properties of figues like color, dimensions, etc
*** 2 levels: polyrithms in the Concur part; an polyrithms in signals
